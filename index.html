        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Harvard University. Previously, I worked as a predoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins University. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at The Ohio State University. 
            <br><br>
            I study the relationship between information and public opinion, with a focus on health. My work approaches this issue from two complementary angles. The first line of research examines how individuals interact with information to form and update their beliefs, primarily using survey experiments. My experimental work on public perceptions of fentanyl overdose victims has been published in <i>Social Science & Medicine</i>, and I have additional collaborative projects underway.
        <br><br>   
        My second line of research examines how publicly-accessible information about health is created in the first place, primarily using comparative-historical methods. My third-year paper, currently in progress, uses the case study of the women's health movement to investigate how scientific information is aggregated and translated for lay audiences. 
        <br><br>
        Outside of the PhD, I am a public science writer for Filter magazine, where I cover new studies about harm reduction and substance use across a wide range of academic disciplines.
        <br><br>
        I was born and raised in Cincinnati, OH and now live in Somerville, MA. I'm an avid runner and love exploring new creative hobbies (currently, watercolor painting).

                (Social Science & Medicine, 2024)</p>       
                <p>
                    Using a vignette survey experiment, I find that Americans lean on narratives of "personal choice" when assigning blame to overdose victims rather than employing traditional race, class, and gender stereotypes.

                    The United States is facing a drug overdose crisis, and stigma against people who use drugs is a major roadblock to implementing solutions. Despite the public health importance of understanding and mitigating substance use stigma, prior research has focused mainly on perceptions of individuals with substance use disorders and a limited set of demographic traits. This leaves critical gaps in our understanding of stigma against fentanyl overdose decedents, who represent a much broader group, including people who use substances recreationally. This study develops a more robust understanding of these attitudes through an experimental vignette survey fielded to a national sample of American adults (n = 1432). Respondents were shown two fictional fentanyl overdose obituaries where a complex suite of decedent characteristics—including demographic traits and contexts of substance use—were randomly varied in a conjoint design. Respondents then endorsed one of the two decedents for each of several attitudinal outcomes, including blameworthiness and support for various interventions, and justified their choices in an open-ended format. Results indicate that the public assesses victims of fentanyl overdose meritocratically, making judgments based on personal history and life experience rather than traditional race, class, and gender status beliefs. While certainly a signal of progress on some fronts, this meritocratic lens conflicts with the public health model of addressing the overdose crisis and exposes the alarming persistence of explicit stigma against people who use drugs.
